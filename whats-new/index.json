No, we are not using Google Forms (nothing wrong in that). We call our portal the \"Dashboard\".</p><p>We made registration process really simple, for you, and for us (not necessarily for our developers).</p><br/><p>In almost every fest, you register using a form. Most of times, they ask you for very useless and repetitive info. Our dashboard will ask you for only to required details, to the point. We'll even fill some info about you if we can get it ;)</p><br/><p>Generally, you don't know which of your friends will be teaming up with you. So we'll let you create the teams at our registration desk real quick. You just need to register yourself online through our registration portal.</p><br/><p>And the best part, we'll give you an e-ticket. Just keep in in your phone/laptop and show it at our registration desks so that we can do the magic. We won't waste your time in writing details about you in spreadsheets or paper for each event! Real Smooth.</p><br/><p>And you can see your progress/stats and leaderboards in the portal.</p><br/><p>If you haven't registered for Sankalan yet, what are you waiting for?
