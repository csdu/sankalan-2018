# Sankalan 2018

This repository contains the source code for Sankalan 2018 website ~(https://www.ducs.in/sankalan/)~ http://jealous-polish.surge.sh/sankalan/2018/.

Sankalan is the annual tech fest of Dept Of Computer Science, University of Delhi (DUCS).

# How to build

Requirements: Node JS (v8.8+), NPM (v5.6) and some npm static website hosting module (like [`live-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server)).

``` bash
# clone repo
git clone https://github.com/sidvishnoi/sankalan-2018.git
cd sankalan-2018

# install dependencies
npm i

# create a dev build
npm run build:dev

# open browser with the built website at port 8080
live-server ./dist --port=8080

# and navigate to /sankalan/ in browser
```

Please use port 8080 to view website. If you want to use some other port or url, please edit it as the `basepath` ( = `'http://localhost:8080/assets'`) in `./scripts/build/utils.js`.

If you need to test the website in some other device, make sure you edit the `basepath`'s hostname to that of the device running the build server.

# Deployment

The current deployment script makes use of `aws-cli` and `git`. You need create an empty git-repo in the dist folder, so thatonly the files that have been actually modified in the build process will be uploaded.

The official website (https://www.ducs.in/sankalan/) is hosted via a combination of AWS S3, Cloudfront and AWS Lambda@Edge.

S3 makes use of two buckets (cdn and www) so the assets in cdn can be cached for longer than www files.

By using a Lambda@Edge function as an "Origin-Request" trigger on cloudfront, we can now have correct responses to paths with/without trailing slashes.

The Cloudfront behaviours for the www distribution look like:

Only the precedence 4 has Lambda@Edge function as trigger.

This is done to reduce requests on Lambda@Edge, as it becomes expensive. In end, only urls without trailing slashes are being handled by the Lambda@Edge function:

``` js
'use strict';
exports.handler = (event, context, callback) => {
    var request = event.Records[0].cf.request;

    var s = request.uri.toLowerCase();
    
    console.log('URL.in = ', s);
    
    // leave files with extensions as it is
    if (/(?=.*)\.([a-z]{3,4})$/.test(s)) return callback(null, request);

	if (s.substr(-1) === '/') s += 'index.html'
	else if (s.endsWith('/index.html')) { /* do nothing */ }
	else s += '/index.html';

    request.uri = s;
    console.log('URL.out = ', s);

    // Return to CloudFront
    return callback(null, request);

};
```
